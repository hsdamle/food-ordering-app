1) What is Redux?
- State management library to handle data in large applications with multiple components.
- Redux is not a part of react. We can develop web applications without using Redux as well.
- Redux is a UI State management library which is also available for other frameworks like angular.
- Redux Toolkit(RTK) is the newer way of writing Redux Logic which is much more simplified than
previous one.

2) Redux architecture with example
Example: in a food ordering app when a user selects a menu from item it should get added to the cart.
    i)  Create a Redux Store.
    ii) Add Cart Slice to the Redux Store.
    iii) When a user clicks on add to cart button, an Action(add item) is dispatched which 
        calls a reducer, and this reducer will update the cart Slice in our Store.
    iv) Now if we want to read that cart value, we subscribe to the cart using a selector.
