1) What is a react element?
- React element is not an HTML element. When you write React.createElement it creates 
    javascript object with metadata of the element that we want to create and when we 
    call the render() method, HTML elements are created from this React Element Object.

2) JSX
- Javascript Syntax to create React Element.
- JSX is not a part of React. You can create React Applications without using JSX as well
- But JSX syntax is easy to write.
- JSX is a convention where we merge HTML and JSX together.
- JSX is not HTML inside Javascript!!!.
- JSX has an HTML like syntax.

3) Transpiling
- Parcel(a webpack) takes JSX code and gives it to BABEL which transpiles it so that 
    JS Engine can understand and render on browser.

4) What is BABEL?
- Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert 
    ECMAScript 2015+ code into backwards-compatible JavaScript code that can be run by older 
    JavaScript engines. 

5) React Component
- Every react element is a component.
- 2 types of component i) Class based component ii) Functional Component.
- React functional component is nothing but a Javascript Function.It is a javascript function
    which return JSX.
