1) What is Higher Order Component?
- Normal Javascript Function which takes a component as Input, enhances the component and returns 
  the enhanced component.

2) Controlled Component
- A component which does not have its own state and is controlled by parent component by passing props 
is known as controlled component.

3) What is props drilling
- Passing the props from one component to the bottom of the tree or passing it in multiple child and then
again these child passing down to their childs is called props drilling.
i.e passing the props down to multiple levels.

4) React Context API
- it is used to avoid props drilling and to access data globally i.e from any component in our 
application without prop drilling.

E.g User auth token can be stored using React Context API which will be used globally in our application.
- You should only use context for data which you want to use globally/or inside multiple sibling components.
