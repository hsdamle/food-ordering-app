1) Monolith Architecture
- When all the services like UI, API, Database, Authentication, DB Connectivity,
Notifications are inside one same project.
- Drawback of this project was even if we have made change in a single service(for e.g change 
color of button), still we need to deploy the whole project.

2) Microservice Architecture
- Each Services like UI, API, DB Connectivity are maintained and deployed seprately
- Each Service has its own project.
- This is also known as Seperation of Concerns.
- Also known as Single Responsibility Principle.
- Advantage of Microservice Architecture is that you can use different tech stack for each service.
for e.g for UI you can use React and for Backend you can use Java.

3) UseEffect
- The useEffect hook has two arguments i] callback function ii] Dependency arrray.
- the callback function will be called after the component is rendered for the first time
after it is being loaded.

4) CORS Policy
- Our browsers block us from calling an API from one origin to another origin.
for e.g calling Swiggy's API from Localhost is not allowed by our browser.

5) Shimmer UI 
- for better User Experience untill the Data is fetched and rendered.
- show UI skelton to be loaded instead of using a loader.

6) Working of UseState and state variables
- we use state variables instead of normal javascript variables because react won't be able to track normal variables.
- when a state variable value is changed, react re-renders the component.

7) How state variables are modified even when they are declared as const variables?
- Whenever a state variable update method is called, react creates a new instance of the component and sets
the state with the updated value. i.e react does not modify the state variable of the component but instead creates
a new instance of the component and assigns updated value to the state variable.

- Whenever you learn any concept in react or in any framework/language...you should know 
why, how and when to use the concept.

8) Why react is fast?
- beacause of the diffing algorithm(React Fiber).
