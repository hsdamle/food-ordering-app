- Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.
- A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) 
  from another domain.
- CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.
- CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page 
  to be requested from another domain outside their own domain. It defines a way of how a browser and 
  server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. 
  CORS allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server, among many other things.
