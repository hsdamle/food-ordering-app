1) When is useEffect callback function called?
- Ideally useEffect function gets called on every render but we can control this behaviour
with the help of Dependency arrray.
    i) useEffect() Without Dependency Array ==> Called on Every Render.
    ii) useEffect() With Empty Dependency Array ==> Called on Intial Render.
    iii) useEffect(() =>, [btnName]) with dependency ==> Called on intial render + whenever any state 
    from dependency array(e.g btnName) gets updated.

2) Why you should never use anchor tag(<a href="/about">About</a>) to link to a route?
- Using anchor tag will refresh the whole page.
- you can navigate to new page without reloading the whole page- using react router dom.
