1) Create React App
- Create react app gives us a production ready react development environment bundled with 
    all features such as bundling, image optimization, chunking, minifying code etc.

2) NPM - (does not stand for Node Package Manager :))
- NPM manages packages but it does not stand for Node Package Manager. Infact there is no
    full form for NPM. You can check on the official website.
- NPM is a package manager for javascript not node.

3) Package.json
- Contains all the dependencies required to run our project, also their versions.
- it is a configuration for npm.
- keeps a track of package versions.

4) What is a bundler?
- There are multiple files in our app which need to bundled together for production.
- webpack, parcel are some examples of a bundler.
- create react app uses webpack bundler benhind the scenes.

5) Dev dependencies and normal dependencies?
- dev dependencies only used for development.

6) caret(^) and tilde(~) in package.json
- caret means package will update to latest minor version (for e.g from 2.8.3 to 2.8.4)after npm install.
- tilde means package will update to latest major version(for e.g from 2.8.3 to 3.0.0).
- it is safe to use caret always.

7) What is package-lock.json?
- Keeps a record of exact version of every package installed.
- it should be pushed to remote repository on git so that whenever we clone and do npm install
    it will intall the exact version of the package which was installed in others machine.

8) what is node_modules folder?
- All the code that we fetched from NPM for installing packages.

9) Transitive dependencies(Important question)
- The dependencies that we install can have their own dependencies as well.
   for e.g if we install parcel package it may require a react package as well.
   and similarly react package can have its own dependencies and so on.

10) What is npx?
- if you want to execute a package you use npx command. 
- similaryly when you want to install a package you use npm command.

11) CDN is not a good way to ignite react in our project.Because?
- fetching from CDN is a expensive operation.
- it will be fast to fetch react from node modules.
- plus if react version changes we will have to keep changing the cdn url.

12) Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports? why?
- Scripts loaded in browser are pure javascript and they don't understand imports.
- so that is why when loading a script in browser which uses react package we need to tell
    the browser that it is a module. By giving type attribute as "module".(type="module").

13) Parcel features.
- Creates Dev Build
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement - Keep reacding all the files for changes and refreshes server
- HMR uses File Watching Algorithm which is written in C++.
- Parcel also gives Faster Builds because it uses Caching.(.parcel-cache folder).
- Image optimization.
- Minification
- Bundling.
- Compressing.
- Consistent Hashing.
- Code Splitting.
- Diffrential Bundling: To support older browsers and various devices browsers like handheld,
    mobile, desktop, etc.
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling.
- allows to Host app on HTTPS.
- Tree shaking - removes unused code for you.

14) How to make our app compatible for older browser versions?
- Using Browserlists: it is an npm package and we need to add config for the browsers we need
    our project compatible with it.
