1) Custom Hooks?
- Nothing but Javascript functions you can create as utility.
for e.g you can create a custom Hook to fetch API Data.

2) Single Responsibility Priniciple
- Each component should have single Responsibility.
for e.g the RestaurantMenu component is responsible for fetching data and rendering the menu. To make it 
compliant with Single Responsibility Priniciple we can create a custom hook to fetch the api data, so now the
Restaurant menu will only be responsible for rendering restaurant menu.

3) Chunking(Code Splitting/ Dynamic Bundling/ Lazy Loading/On Demand Loading)
- Splliting of your bundled JS Files.
